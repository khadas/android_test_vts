VTS stands for __Vendor Test Suite__, and is the standard test suite of Android system.

Developer testing refers to using tests written by developers with component
domain expertise and is usually used to test a feature or a bug fix that was
recently developed or is under development.

VTS structural testing framework is developed to encourage such TDD
(Test-Driven Development) culture in the Android system development.
Historically, TDD was not widely used in certain consumer electronics industry segments
as compared with some other industry (e.g., for mission-critical or high-availability systems).
As the Android system is being used widely (i.e., requiring frequent security
patching and fast feature launch velocity), we think that it is a right cultural shift for this time.

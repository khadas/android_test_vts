# Android Vendor Test Suite (VTS)

VTS consists of a set of testing frameworks and testcases, designed to help
Android SoC Vendors, Device Manufactures, OEMs, and other partners
enhance the robustness, reliability, and compatibility of:

  * the Android system (e.g., HALs and libraries) and
  * low-level system software (e.g., kernel, module, and firmware).

VTS has mainly two types of test suites:
  * automated (e.g., fuzzing) and
  * structural (e.g., gTest) testing.

Everyone can download the VTS package from the AOSP website, and
run the VTS tests in order to produce a VTS report,
which can be submitted to the Android Partner Engineering
to obtain a certificate.
